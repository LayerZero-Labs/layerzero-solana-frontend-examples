Minimal setups to demonstrate how to use the `@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk` package in a frontend repo.

Note that currently, examples only incorporate `oft.quote` as a way to demonstrate the minimal viable configuration in order to make importing of `@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk` work for the particular setup.

The Vite example is prioritized for completeness while the others exist to show the minimum viable setup.
