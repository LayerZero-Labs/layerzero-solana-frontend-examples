## LayerZero Solana Frontend Example

Minimal setups to demonstrate how to use the [`@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk) package in a frontend repo.

This repo contains three examples:
- next
- next-reown
- vite

The [`./vite`](./vite) example is currently the most complete while the others exist to demonstrate the minimal configuration needed to use the Solana OFT SDK.


## Disclaimer

The wallet connection implementations may not be optimal (e.g. if changing accounts in a Solana wallet, the change is not detected).
The purpose of this repo is exclusively to demonstrate how to integrate the LayerZero OFT SDKs in the frontend, and not to demonstrate how to use wallet SDKs. For guidance on the proper use of wallet SDKs, please refer to their documentation.
