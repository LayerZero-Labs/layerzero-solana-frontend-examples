## LayerZero Solana Frontend Example

Minimal setups to demonstrate how to use the [`@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@layerzerolabs/oft-v2-solana-sdk) package in a frontend repo.

This repo contains three examples:
- next
- next-reown
- vite

The [`./vite`](./vite) example is currently the most complete while the others exist to demonstrate the minimal configuration needed to use the Solana OFT SDK.
